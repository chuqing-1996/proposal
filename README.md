Proposal of my final project 
Compared with last year, the number of College Students' recruitment demand decreased by 16.77% in the first quarter, and the number of job applicants increased by 69.82%. The CIER index was lower than that of 2.82 in the same period of last year. 
From the perspective of expected employment industry, graduates are more inclined to the new economy industry, with the highest proportion of 25.1% expected to work in it / communication / Internet industry. 
In view of the rapidly changing job market, as a graduate student who has just entered the society, I hope to set up a job search website specially prepared for fresh graduates to collect the information of autumn and spring recruitment of major Internet enterprises, and provide online guidance for these students to apply for jobs.This is for the students who want to attend to the Internet Industries. 

Name of my website: Jobme 

Problem Statement 
How can we collect the information of autumn and spring recruitment of all famous enterprises and plan the delivery priority for students from different regions? Should we create a resume entry for students and help them improve their resume? How can we better reflect the value of the deliverers, how to help them have a direct dialogue with their employers, so that there is no barrier between the third party and the new students can get the most intuitive feedback. 

Pain Points 
1. We hope to screen out the false information of the employer and whether the credit system of the employer company should be established; 
2. In view of the special situation of COVID-19 , students are eager for online practice opportunities, 
so they can summarize a page of online practiceï¼Œand also apply for a online interview. 
3. How to solve the process of College Students' job-hunting, how to sort out a complete learning path to help students find their favorite positions as soon as possible; 
4. Job search websites are generally boring and serious, which can't attract young people. Should we make a secondary transformation of the website from the perspective of art.
